its working pretty well, but there are a few bugs.
before talking about the bugs, general issues:
	i changed lines 59-61 of main.cpp so it works now
	the formatting of your code isnt the best
	use tabs appropriately where needed, or right click in code blocks and use the a style formatter
	from now onwards, format the code in thiss folder, not some other files(ive changed the cbp file accordingly)

bugs:
	everytime i catch a coin, it counts it as two coins
	there seem to be redundant dead coins that dont move, and dont need to be shown(only show the coins that i can catch)
	sometimes, even after catching a coin... the coin keeps moving(so there are two coins now, one attached to the lasso, and one that contnues moving)
	the lasso fails to catch coins even if they are inside the loop at times
